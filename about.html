            <h2>Undergrad and Shortly After</h2>
            <p>From 2013 to 2018 I worked on getting my B.S in Psychology where I learned the fundamental skills to conduct research through classwork and practice.
                I worked on several studies as a research assistant gaining the foundation upon which I would ultimately build my career. It was here I found I was much more
                inclined to work with surveys and the backend data, than I was to conduct interviews or meet with participants. While I found this work more rewarding, 
                I struggled to find consistent opportunities to explore this deeper as the studies needed the assistants to run the experiments while graduate students ran
                most of the preliminary data analysis. While I knew I was interested in data, I was also interested in maintaining my original goal of working with and improving
                the life of kids. Leading me to accept my first job out of college, a residential counselor assistant at Echo Glen.

            <h2>Back to Research</h2>
            <p>
                From 2018 to 2019, I worked in several units in what is one of the most unique and challenging roles I have ever been in. As a counselor, I worked with kids
                in the most difficult of positions, those who have been convicted of serious crimes. While I loved working with the kids, the work was unsustainable. Mandatory overtime, 
                understaffed units, and unrealistic expectations from management pushed me away from fulfilling work. Even as I worked with the kids, I found myself unable to resist making
                behavioral spreadsheets to try and find patterns to better helps my caseload succeed in their time at Echo Glen and beyond. This lead me to make a change, and I sought a job as
                a clinical research coordinator at Seattle Children's Hospital.

            <h2>Back to School</h2>
            <p>
                From 2019 to 2022, I was so fortunate to get to continue to work with kids, get back into research, and work with Echo Glen again as a part of a research study at Seattle Children's Hospital. I was able 
                to make great connections, re-connect with some of my old co-workers and caseloads, as well as seek opportunities to get hands on experience with data in all of it's stages.
                Some of my greatest professional development happened at Seattle Children's. Something that wouldn't have been possbile without the never ending support from my Principal Investigator's
                Dr. Michelle Garrison and Dr. Kym Ahrens. While working on their studies I was able to build new skills, make new connection, get into and graduate a Master's program, and put my skills to use.
                Despite the challenges, I could not be more grateful for the wonderful people and experiences I had at Seattle Children's.

            <h2>Currently</h2>
            <p>
                In my current role as a Data Analyst, I am focusing on not just learning but also deepening my understanding of the tools and skills available to me.
                So far, I have been able to be a part of building some really cool projects and the autonomy I have to complete tasks has allowed me to push myself to set my own limits. I want to use the next 2-3
                years to become an expert in my craft. I want to build more in python, R, SQL, and interact with whatever new tech comes our way! I have a great many challenges ahead of me in this role, but I am excited to face them head on.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What next?</h2>
            <p>
            I am not currently looking for a new role, but I am always available for a chat about what the future might hold. In the next two-three years, I see myself moving to a data scientist/engineer role.
            The title matters less to me than the ability to work on cool projects and be in a position of constant learning.

            <h2>What Linkedin won't show you</h2>
            <p>Outside of work and professional endeavors I love to box, play chess, watch football, play in the web3 space, and build or rebuild whatever tech I can get my hands on. 
                In the winter I love to ski, in the summer I switch to paddleboarding and in-between I golf. I am certainly not afraid to try anything new unless it involves roller-coasters. 
                Those steel/wood monstrosities are just bad trains designed by those who don't believe in gravity and no one can convince me otherwise. If there is a company day at an amusement park, you'll find 
                me holding down the Elephant Ear stand.
