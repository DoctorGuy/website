            <h2>Phase 1: Exploration</h2>
            <p>From 2013 to 2018 I worked on getting my B.S in Psychology where I learned the fundemental skills to conduct research through classwork and practice.
                I worked on several studies as a research assitant gaining the foundation upon which I would ultimately build my career. It was here I found I was much more
                inclined to work with surveys and the backend data, than I was to conduct interviews or meet with participants. While I found this work more rewarding, 
                I struggled to find consitent opprotunities to explore this deeper as the studies needed the assistants to run the experiments while graduate students ran
                most of the preliminary data analysis. While I knew I was interested in data, I was also interested in maintaining my original goal of working with and improving
                the life of kids. Leading me to accept my first job out of college, a residential counselor assistant at Echo Glen.

            <h2>Phase 2: Experimentation</h2>
            <p>
                From 2018 to 2019, i worked in several units in what is one of the most unique and challenging roles I have ever been in. As a counselor, I worked with kids
                in the most difficult of positions, those who have been covicted of serious crimes. While i loved working with the kids, the work was unsastainable. Mandatory overtime, 
                understaffed units, and unrealistic expectations from management pushed me away from fulfilling work. Even as I worked with the kids, I found myself unable to resit making
                behavioral spreadsheets to try and find patterns to better helps my caseload succeed in their time at Echo Glen and beyond. This lead me to make a change, and I sought a job as
                a clinical reserch coordinator at Seattle children's.

            <h2>Phase 3: Distinction</h2>
            <p>
                From 2019 to 2022, I was so fortunate to get to continue to work with kids, get back into research, and work with Echo Glen again at Seattle Children's Hospital. I was able 
                to make great connections, re-connect with some of my old co-workers and caseloads, as well as seek opporunites to get hands on expereince with data. Despite the challenges,
                such as a graduate school and a world wide pandemic, I could not be more grateful for the wonderful people and expeirences I had at Seattle Children's.

            <h2>Phase 4: Specialization</h2>
            <p>
                In my current role as a Data analyst, I am focusing on not just learning but also deepening my understanding of the tools and skills available to me. I want to use the next 2-3
                years to become an expert in my craft. I have a great many challenges ahead of me in this role, but I am excited to face them head on.

            <h2>What Linkedin won't show you</h2>
            <p>Outside of work and professional endeavors I love to box, play chess, watch football, play in the web3 space, and build or rebuild whatever tech I can get my hands on. 
                In the winter I love to ski, in the summer I switch to paddlebaording and in-between I golf. Certainly not afraid to try anything new unless it involves roller-coasters. 
                Those steel/wood monstrosities are just bad trains designed by a mad man and no one can convince me otherwise. If there is a company day at an amusement park, you'll find 
                me holding down the Elephant Ear stand.
