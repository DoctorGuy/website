    <p>Let's take a look at my fantasy team this year. I came in third, and I want to use the power of hindsight to get a better idea of what I can do to perform better enxt year. 
        In my league, we have 10 teams, with each team starting one Quater back (QB), two Running backs(RB), two Wide Recievers (WR), one Tight End (TE), one Defense/Special Teams (D/ST), and one Kicker (K).
        We also have a flex spot that could contain either an RB, WR, or TE. We have seven bench spots that can contain any back-ups not already on other teams. We use a half-points per receiption scoring format placing a little more weight on position's outside QB.
    </p>
    <p>
    A little context for my league, we've been playing for 3 years and no one ever wants to trade. I do not know why, but it is what it is, so the draft and waiver wire picks are increadibly important. 
    Draft strategies very wildly, and there is a lot of planning and practicing that go into them, but I decided to do the following:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Ignore TE completely and get a rookie</li>
        <li>Aim for a value pick at QB</li>
        <li>Grab as many safe WR/RB options as I could as quickly as I could</li>
      </ol>
    <p>So using the power of hindsight, and pretending that if I were to make a differnt pick, I'd essentially swap the new pick with the other team, I decided to test out three strategies.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Ignore TE completely and get a rookie</li>
        <li>Aim for a value pick at QB</li>
        <li>Grab as many safe WR/RB options as I could as quickly as I could</li>
      </ol>
