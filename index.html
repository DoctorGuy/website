        <p>My name is Elliott Wills and  I am a data professional living in Seattle, Washington. 
            One of my favorite things is to build systems and tech to improve the way we interact with
            and understand our digital world. I'm always working on learning something new so stay tuned and watch me grow! </p>
        <p>I love learning and working with new tools and languages to build creative solutions to real world problems. This site began
            as a way for me to practice my skills and now serves as my portfolio. 
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a Data Analyst out of Seattle with Qualtrics on the Data Intergrity Team. I've learned so much and built some really cool stuff that I can't quite share yet!</p>
