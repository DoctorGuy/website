        <p>My name is Elliott Wills and  I am a data professional living in Seattle, Washington. 
            One of my favorite things is to build systems and tech to improve the way we interact with
            and understand our digital world. I don't know everything yet, but I'm working on it. </p>
        <p>I love learning and working with new tools and languages to build creative solutions to real world problems. This site began
            as a way for me to practice my skills and now serves as my portfolio. 
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a data analyst in Seattle on our data intergrity team and I build reports and procedures to identify, notify, and correct incoming data.</p>
